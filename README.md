# OldPhonePad

This project emulates the logic of typing text on an old telephone keypad. Given an input of keys pressed, the resulting text is decoded, applying rules such as:

- Spaces separate key sequences (letter confirmation).
- `#` indicates the end of the message.
- `*` deletes the last confirmed letter.
